🤖 AutoCrew: Autonomous Financial Modeling System🌟 Project OverviewAutoCrew is a novel automated system designed to streamline and govern the end-to-end process of financial model development. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) orchestrated by the CrewAI framework, AutoCrew takes a natural language task description (e.g., "Build a credit risk model") and autonomously executes a multi-step workflow, culminating in a fully validated and audited model output.The system is structured around two specialized, sequential Agent Crews to ensure regulatory compliance and robust Model Risk Management (MRM).💡 Key FeaturesAutonomous Workflow: Executes the entire modeling pipeline from data preparation to final risk sign-off without human intervention.Dual-Crew Architecture: Enforces separation of duties via a Modeling Crew (construction) and an MRM Crew (validation and audit).LLM Acceleration: Utilizes high-performance LLMs (Meta Llama 3.1 8B via Groq LPU and Google Gemini 1.5 Flash) for low-latency reasoning and code generation.Built-in Simulator: Features a Stress Testing Engineer agent capable of running economic shock simulations to validate model stability.Compliance Ready: All outputs are accompanied by an audit trail generated by the Compliance Officer.🏗️ System ArchitectureAutoCrew employs a hierarchical agent system managed by CrewAI.CrewAgents IncludedPrimary ResponsibilityModeling CrewData Analyst, ML Engineer, Technical WriterData cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and initial documentation.MRM CrewCompliance Officer, Stress Testing Engineer, Chief Risk OfficerCode audit, stress testing simulation, and final regulatory approval/sign-off.🚀 Getting StartedFollow these steps to set up and run the AutoCrew system locally.1. PrerequisitesPython 3.10+Git2. Clone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AutoCrew-Financial-Agent-System.git
cd AutoCrew-Financial-Agent-System
3. Setup Virtual Environment and DependenciesBashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure API Keys (Critical Security Step)Create a file named .env in the root directory. Do not commit this file to GitHub. Obtain your keys from the respective providers.GROQ_API_KEY=YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE
GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
5. Run AutoCrewExecute the main script. You will be prompted to select an LLM (Groq is recommended for speed).Bashpython -m src.main
🎯 Example WorkflowUpon running, AutoCrew processes the task for the Credit Default Prediction dataset, generating a trained model and a detailed final report approved by the Chief Risk Officer.🛑 Security and ComplianceThe system ensures that sensitive API keys are never tracked by Git via the .gitignore file.1 All agent actions are logged for a full audit trail, fulfilling a key requirement of Model Risk Management protocols.📜 License[Specify your license here, e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, or None if you haven't decided.]🤝 Sarim Shah - sarimoman@gmail.com
